# codex-task: --retries for transient capacity and sandbox failures (../codex-task repo)

## Requirement

Retro item from the 2026-07-10 parallel run (targets the sibling repo ../codex-task, which has no board of its own — tracked here, same pattern as T20260710T0036Z).

Three codex-task dispatches failed on transient causes and all succeeded on a manual immediate retry: gpt-5.6-terra "Selected model is at capacity" (twice, mid-run after 180s+ of work), and one Windows sandbox failure ("windows unelevated restricted-token sandbox cannot enforce split writable root sets directly; refusing to run unsandboxed" during apply_patch, stacked with a capacity error). Each manual retry cost orchestrator attention and a full re-read of the project by codex.

## Scope (all in ../codex-task)

1. codex-task.mjs: add --retries <n> (default 0, keeping current behavior). On a failed run, classify the diagnostic tail with the existing codexFailureHint machinery family: transient classes = model-capacity ("at capacity", rate limit/429) and sandbox-wrapper failures ("failed to prepare windows sandbox wrapper"); non-transient = auth, unsupported model/effort, prompt/JSON contract failures. Retry only transient classes, up to n times, with a short fixed backoff; surface attempt count in the result JSON (attempts field) and a warning entry per retried failure.
2. Serial discipline unchanged: retries are sequential within the single invocation.
3. SKILL.md: document the flag under wrapper options with the transient-class list; note the default preserves current behavior.
4. tests/cli-smoke.test.mjs: fake-codex shim gains a fail-N-times-then-succeed mode; tests for transient-retry-success, non-transient-no-retry, retries-exhausted, and attempts/warnings surfacing.

## Acceptance criteria

- --retries 2 with a shim failing once on a capacity-class message succeeds with attempts: 2 and one warning.
- An auth-class failure with --retries 2 fails immediately (attempts: 1).
- Omitting the flag is byte-identical to today.
- npm run check and npm test pass in ../codex-task.

## Non-goals

- No parallel dispatch, no CODEX_HOME isolation (separate concern).
- No retry of contract failures (bad JSON etc.) — those need prompt fixes, not repeats.
